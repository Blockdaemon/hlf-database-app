# hlf-database-app
Skeleton for building a Hyperledger Fabric database app

Based on [this tutorial](https://chainhero.io/2018/03/tutorial-build-blockchain-app-2/)

Requires [a service network](https://github.com/Blockdaemon/hlf-service-network)

Note that the above uses HLF 1.0.5 and this repo (by default) does not pin the FABSDK depenedency, so it is unlikely to work out of the box currently.
